## *My Personal Graphic Design Portfolio*

------------

For my first ever website from scratch, I knew I wanted to create a portfolio site for myself. I had previously attempted to build my own website using Squarespace and for someone who is as particular as I am, it was a disaster. I didn't have the control and precision I would have liked, and just finished it so it could be done, and I would have something to reference to for job interviews. 

I've been interested in coding and website design since I was 14 on MySpace customzing my own profile for hours and hours. I recently learned the basics to Twitter BootStrap and how it's essentially a model kit from a craft store. You can select a model 'components' and then take it home to give it your own custom paint job 'fill with your own content'.

As much as I want to say I started with a wire frame, I just dove right in and got about as far as setting up my navigation bar and customizing the font family and color before I remembered I had no clue how I wanted the rest of my content to be laid out. So I booted up Illustrator and whipped up a quick mock up of my final design.

Once I created the map of my website, I just needed to follow my own directions.

## Building the Site

I started with the about me section. I copied the general layout of an in-class assignment for the placement, but I researched how to add text wrap on my own. 
The easiest part was filling the website with content. Like I mentioned previously, I already had a website I had previously built so I had a lot of the sizing and exporting already completed. I was especially excited to see that my .GIF still moves when placed!

Honestly, my most time consuming task was adjusting the spacing of the images to be dynamic in different web browser sizes. The second most time consuming task was figuring out why my carousel component wouldn't switch slides automatically, or even when prompted by pressing the buttons. 

Luckily, they were both quick fixes. Images require the 'col-#' class to get my desired spacing. I had to use different class tags in the images for FUNK Magazine since there were more, differently sized images. PrettyLugoThings and Salud Cafe used the same tag because their images are the same sizes. And the carousel was even quicker, I just needed to link Bootstrap's javascript sheet and once I did that, I adjusted the sizing and I was good to go. 

Screenshots of my deployed website can be seen below. I had a lot of fun creating this, and I can't wait to see how much more I'll grow in skill and finesse as time goes on!
