# Portfolio
## *My Personal Graphic Design Portfolio*

------------

For my first ever website from scratch, I knew I wanted to create a portfolio site for myself. I had previously attempted to build my own website using Squarespace and for someone who is as particular as I am, it was a disaster. I didn't have the control and precision I would have liked, and just finished it so it could be done, and I would have something to reference to for job interviews. 

I've been interested in coding and website design since I was 14 on MySpace customzing my own profile for hours and hours. I recently learned the basics to Twitter BootStrap and how it's essentially a model kit from a craft store. You can select a model 'components' and then take it home to give it your own custom paint job 'fill with your own content'.

As much as I want to say I started with a wire frame, I just dove right in and got about as far as setting up my navigation bar and customizing the font family and color before I remembered I had no clue how I wanted the rest of my content to be laid out. So I booted up Illustrator and whipped up a quick mock up of my final design.
