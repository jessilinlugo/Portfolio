                    my 2nd collaborative project I recently helped design and complete. TRACKSTAR is an application in
                    which a registered user can input a tracking number for their pending delivery, and track their
                    package in "real time" as the arrows at the bottom update from Placed to In Transit. Once an item
                    has been delivered, the package is moved to the delivered tab. I had a lot of fun creating the wire
                    frame for this application, and the overall look and design of the website was a collaborative
                    effort (except for the areas where I made Executive Artistic Decisions, such as the font used in the
                    logo and headers). I call wire frames instructional manuals, because once you've created and are
                    happy with your wire frame, the only thing left to do is follow the pictures and set up the code to
                    match. I had a lot of fun designing the logo, icon, and interface, and it definitely cemented the
                    idea that I'd like to go into the UI/UX field.

                    a collaborative project I recently helped
                    complete. Once a user has inputted a tv or movie title, two separate APIs (OMDb and uTelly) are
                    called to display the relevant information. A poster, title, critics score, release date, runtime,
                    and a brief description are all displayed as a result of the search. As well as any applicable
                    streaming service icons leading directly to the title on the corresponding streaming platform. The
                    User Interface is designed to mimic the cinema experience. With so many theaters shutting down, and
                    our bedrooms and living rooms doubling as home theaters, Will It Stream was created for the home
                    viewer in mind. </p>

                        Day Scheduler</strong> was an exercise in JavaScript in which I really
                    shined. The application is essentially a daily planner, in which to lay out and schedule your day.
                    The planner runs on a timer and will change the color of the text box based on the time of day. The
                    hours that have passed will be highlighted a light yellow, the current hour is a muted red, and the
                    remaining hours of the day are a soothing green. I didn't want the color palette to be overwhelming
                    for users, and felt the muted winter's day aesthetic was perfect for the short days and long nights.

                    <BR> <strong>Team Info Generator</strong> was the first Node/Javascript application I created that
                    actually works. I spent a lot of time studying and reviewing class lectures in order to really
                    understand this assignment. This application runs the terminal in Javascript and allows a user to
                    run through a series of prompts in order to generate an HTML website containing their team's
                    information. Different titles have different information listed, such as Managers have office
                    numbers, Engineers have their Github username/repository linked, and Interns have their educational
                    institute listed. Along with the single alternating line, each title has it's own corresponding icon
                    to represent the employee. Because I was more focused on the functionality of the application,
                    versus the UI, I didn't spend much time updating the HTML to match the aesthetic of most of my
                    projects.

                    creative inspiration
                    strikes me at any odd moment. I like to dabble in different art styles and I felt branching out on
                    my
                    own was the only way I was going to get to experiment with free reign. Also, I feel this helps give
                    people a better idea of how versatile I can be, and can adapt to any design or theme presented to
                    me. I
                    like to do research to make sure I get even tiny details correct, but also just because I love
                    learning
                    new things and getting lost in new information. Additionally, I like to dabble in art forms that
                    aren’t
                    digital, in which I can flex my photography and photo editing skills but also show off my latest

                    of the copy in my magazine is filler because I’m just trying to showcase my layouts, but in another

                    haven’t noticed already, I am Latina, and I love to use my culture for my designs. With Salud Cafe,
                    I
                    decided that it would be a restaurant with a specialty dish from each South American country. My dad
                    was
                    born in Mexico, and my mom was born in El Salvador, because of this, I’ve always been aware of the
                    differences in each country’s culture and the nuance in which we prepare similar dishes. Each of
                    these
                    countries has a different way they prepare rice, or tamales, but each are delicious and amazing in
                    their
                    own respects. Everybody knows about fusion restaurants, but I wanted a restaurant that would prepare
                    a
                    signature dish for each South American country, with no substitutions for ingredients or cooking
                    methods. I love my culture and where I’m from, and I love sharing it with others to learn and
                    partake in
                    as well. Food is a big thing in Latin American culture, it brings people together, and helps to
                    smooth
                    over arguments and when the food tastes good, you feel good.
