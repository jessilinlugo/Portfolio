                <p class="about p-4"><strong>Will It Stream</strong> is a collaborative project I recently helped complete. Once a user has inputted a tv or movie title, two separate APIs (OMDb and uTelly) are called to display the relevant information. A poster, title, critics score, release date, runtime, and a brief description are all displayed as a result of the search. As well as any applicable streaming service icons leading directly to the title on the corresponding streaming platform. The User Interface is designed to mimic the cinema experience. With so many theaters shutting down, and our bedrooms and living rooms doubling as home theaters, Will It Stream was created for the home viewer in mind. </p>

                <p class="about p-4"><strong>Week Day Scheduler</strong> was an exercise in JavaScript in which I really shined. The application is essentially a daily planner, in which to lay out and schedule your day. The planner runs on a timer and will change the color of the text box based on the time of day. The hours that have passed will be highlighted a light yellow, the current hour is a muted red, and the remaining hours of the day are a soothing green. I didn't want the color palette to be overwhelming for users, and felt the muted winter's day aesthetic was perfect for the short days and long nights. </p>

Selecting one of the answer buttons will take you to the next page which displays a different question. There are 5 questions to click through, and once you finish, you're supposed to be presented with a Game Over page, displaying your score. However, it took me about 8 or 9 hours just to get to the point of having the screen display the 1st question. Then an additional hour with a tutor to be able to run through the following questions. My ultimate goal is to be able to add a timer, score counter to keep track of the correct answers as you run through the quiz, and make your choices. Although truthfully, because it's been so difficult, the little successes have been that much more rewarding. </p>

                    creative inspiration
                    strikes me at any odd moment. I like to dabble in different art styles and I felt branching out on
                    my
                    own was the only way I was going to get to experiment with free reign. Also, I feel this helps give
                    people a better idea of how versatile I can be, and can adapt to any design or theme presented to
                    me. I
                    like to do research to make sure I get even tiny details correct, but also just because I love
                    learning
                    new things and getting lost in new information. Additionally, I like to dabble in art forms that
                    aren’t
                    digital, in which I can flex my photography and photo editing skills but also show off my latest
                    amazing
                    new creation.</p>

                    striking magazine layouts, and they tend to have thought provoking content to go along with it. Most
                    of the copy in my magazine is filler because I’m just trying to showcase my layouts, but in another
                    life I went into some writing career. </p>

                <p class="about p-3">
                    <strong>Salud Cafe</strong> began as a branding assignment, and eventually was developed into so much more. If you
                    haven’t noticed already, I am Latina, and I love to use my culture for my designs. With Salud Cafe,
                    I
                    decided that it would be a restaurant with a specialty dish from each South American country. My dad
                    was
                    born in Mexico, and my mom was born in El Salvador, because of this, I’ve always been aware of the
                    differences in each country’s culture and the nuance in which we prepare similar dishes. Each of
                    these
                    countries has a different way they prepare rice, or tamales, but each are delicious and amazing in
                    their
                    own respects. Everybody knows about fusion restaurants, but I wanted a restaurant that would prepare
                    a
                    signature dish for each South American country, with no substitutions for ingredients or cooking
                    methods. I love my culture and where I’m from, and I love sharing it with others to learn and
                    partake in
                    as well. Food is a big thing in Latin American culture, it brings people together, and helps to
                    smooth
                    over arguments and when the food tastes good, you feel good.
